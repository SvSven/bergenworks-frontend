# Bergen.Works frontend
Frontend for the Bergen.Works website, built with React and Next.js - this is meant to be the frontend for a headless CMS. The backend for the Bergen.Works website can be found [here](https://github.com/SvSven/bergenworks-backend-wp)

### TODO (long term)
* See if what we store in redux can be migrated over to use the context API
